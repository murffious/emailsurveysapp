## Survey for the internet of things
With the wave of ideas flowing for the internet of things. One ting I hear is that there is a great opportunity financially in the industry of internet of thigns. Billions of dollars. What ideas do you have?

with js modules and import statements you cannot do logic of what and what not to load like you can on back end with require. 


TO DO 
Front end - Improve design - some type of pie chart or bar chart for yes no - last responded date on card
Back end - Allow users to delete surveys that have been created - 
Front and Back - Allow users to specify the "from' field on survey emails - maybe have people to be able to add comments to send back to address YES 
Front - Allow client side sorting of surveys with buttons - last answered, most votes 
Front and Back - Allow surveys to be created in "draft" mode to not lose partially created surveys
